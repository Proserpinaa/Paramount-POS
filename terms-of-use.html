      <p>1.<span style='font-weight: 600;'>Customer Obligations.</span> Customer may enable access to the Service,
        Software, and Hardware for use only by Authorized Parties solely for the
        Business Purposes of Customer at Locations in accordance with the
        Documentation; provided, however, Customer may enable access to the
        consumer-facing functionality and features of the Service, Software and
        Hardware for use by Consumers. Customer is responsible for all
        Authorized Party and Consumer use of the Service, Software, and
        Hardware and compliance with this Agreement, as well as restricting
        access by any individual who is no longer an Authorized Party. Customer
        shall: (a) have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality, and legality of
        all Customer Data; (b) grant User IDs to individual named Authorized
        Parties; (c) require that all Authorized Parties keep User ID and password
        information strictly confidential and not share such information with any
        third party; (d) prevent unauthorized access to, or use of, the Service,
        Software, and Hardware, and notify Paramount POS promptly of any such
        unauthorized access or use (including any unauthorized access or use
        caused by misuse or misappropriation of User IDs or passwords); and (e)
        comply with its obligations under all Laws applicable to Customer&#39;s use of
        the Service, Software, and Hardware, including all such Laws related to
        privacy, data security, and data protection. Customer shall not: (i) use the
        Service, Software, or Hardware in violation of applicable Laws; (ii) in
        connection with the Service, Software, or Hardware, send or store
        infringing, obscene, threatening, or otherwise unlawful or tortious material,
        including material that violates privacy rights; (iii) send or store Malicious
        Code in connection with the Service, Software, or Hardware; (iv) interfere
        with or disrupt performance of the Service, Software, or the data contained
        therein; or (v) attempt to gain access to the Service, Software, or
        Hardware or their related systems or networks in a manner not set forth in
        the Documentation. Customer shall be liable for the acts and omissions of
        all Authorized Parties and Consumers relating to this Agreement.
      </p>

      <p>2.<span style='font-weight: 600;'>Dedicated Use.</span> The Service and Software are intended to operate
        together with the Hardware to provide a comprehensive point of sale
        solution. Customer agrees to use the Hardware solely in connection with
        the Service and Software in accordance with the Documentation, and shall
        not attempt to reconfigure or use the Hardware for any other purposes (for
        example, Customer shall ensure that its employees do not install apps on
        the Paramount POS iPads, do not use Paramount POS iPads to browse
        the internet, and do not attempt to reconfigure point of sale peripherals to
        perform other functions or connect to other devices).
      </p>

      <p>3.<span style='font-weight: 600;'>Restrictions.</span> Customer shall not, without Paramount POS's prior written
        consent, use, duplicate, or disclose any data or information relating to the
        Service, Software, or Hardware that is made available by Paramount POS
        in connection with this Agreement, including any information related to the
        features, functionality, performance, pricing, application, or construction of
        any portion of the Paramount POS Platform. Customer shall not use the
        Service, Software, or Hardware for benchmarking or testing performance,
        or for enhancing any products or services that relate to point of sale,
        payment processing, or commerce data. Customer shall only use the
        Service, Software, and Hardware for Customer&#39;s Business Purposes at
        the Locations, and for no other purpose and at no other location; provided
        that, following the expiration or termination of this Agreement, Customer
        shall be permitted to retain and use without restriction the Third Party
        Hardware and any Purchased Hardware for which Customer has made full
        payment, provided that Customer must cease using the Third Party
        Hardware and Purchased Hardware as part of the Paramount POS
        Platform and disable access to and/or de-install the Software, API/XMLs
        and Service.
      </p>

      <p>4.<span style='font-weight: 600;'>POS Transactions.</span> The Paramount POS Platform is designed to give
        Customer flexibility in configuring its point of sale systems. Consequently,
        it is critical that Customer understands how to configure and use
        Customer&#39;s POS Terminals and Back End portal, and that Customer
        ensures that transactions are properly processed and credited to
        Customer&#39;s bank, loyalty and other relevant accounts. Customer
        acknowledges that it is Customer&#39;s obligation to seek assistance if
        Customer has any questions about the processing and crediting of
        Customer&#39;s point of sale transactions or if Customer needs assistance with
        the configuration and operation of the Paramount POS Platform or third
        party products, software and services, and Paramount POS will have no
        liability as a result of Customer&#39;s failure to do so. Customer further
        acknowledges that it is Customer&#39;s obligation to ensure on an ongoing
        basis that payments, loyalty transactions and any other transactions
        running through the Paramount POS Platform are processed properly, and
        that the respective currency, credit, loyalty points, or other applicable
        transaction proceeds are accurately deposited in Customer&#39;s relevant
        accounts, and Paramount POS will have no liability as a result of
        Customer&#39;s failure to do so. In that regard, Customer will perform a
        minimum of three (3) test transactions (e.g. $0.01 transactions) before
        going live (e.g. into production) to ensure that transactions processed on
        the Paramount POS Platform are properly credited to Customer&#39;s account
        (the &quot;Test Transactions&quot;). Customer shall retain documentation of all
        Test Transactions during the Term of this Agreement and for one (1) year
        thereafter and will provide such documentation to Paramount POS upon
        request. Further, Customer agrees that, on at least a daily basis (and
        more often if reasonably prudent under the circumstances) , Customer
        shall check, validate and ensure that (a) all proceeds from Customer&#39;s
        point of sale transactions were deposited in Customer&#39;s accounts timely
        and in full (net of any charges that Customer has agreed to pay to
        payment processors); (b) data relating to loyalty, incentive or other similar
        programs was processed properly; and (c) point of sale transactions are
        batched daily to fully reconcile payment details with Customer&#39;s payment
        processing vendors, payment gateway and financial institutions. Customer
        assumes the responsibility to train and instruct the Authorized Parties
        regarding all of the foregoing Customer obligations and Paramount POS
        will have no liability as a result of Customer&#39;s failure to do so.
      </p>

      <p>5.<span style='font-weight: 600;'>Internet Access.</span> Customer acknowledges that access to and use of the
        full functionality of the Paramount POS Platform requires a high-speed
        internet connection and that Customer is responsible for procuring and
        maintaining the network connections that connect the Hardware and
        Software to the Service. If Customer uses any internet wireless router or
        other network access technology or network-enabled devices provided by
        , Customer agrees that Paramount POS will have the right (although not
        the obligation) to encrypt and filter internet traffic for data security
        purposes and to otherwise manage or modify internet data transmissions.

      </p>

      <p>2.<span style='font-weight: 600;'>Always-On Mode.</span> The Paramount POS Platform may be configured to
        operate in an offline mode, so that Customer&#39;s point of sale terminals may
        continue to process credit cards, loyalty cards and other remote server-
        based transactions even if the connection to the internet or to the payment
        processor is temporarily discontinued (&quot;Offline Transactions&quot;). While in
        offline mode, Offline Transactions are processed locally, without receiving
        a final confirmation from a remote server that the respective transactions
        were in fact completed. Consequently, with Offline Transactions Customer
        assumes the risk and will be solely responsible if credit card transactions
        processed offline are not approved if the credit cards are declined by a
        payment processor or financial institution when the connection with the
        remote servers is reestablished. Customer agrees to verify that the
        Paramount POS Platform is properly configured to process credit cards
        and other transactions that require remote server responses, including by
        verifying at least once a day (and more often if reasonably prudent under
        the circumstances) that Customer&#39;s account is properly credited for the full
        amounts of the purchase transaction conducted using the Paramount POS
        Platform. Customer hereby assumes all liability and responsibility for
        training and instructing Authorized Parties to verify multiple times each
        day that the Paramount POS Platform is not operating inadvertently in an
        offline mode, that the connection to the payment processor is and remains
        properly configured, and that any Offline Transactions are accurately
        processed when the connection to the remote servers is reestablished.
